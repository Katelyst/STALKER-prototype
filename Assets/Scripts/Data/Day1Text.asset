    read my e-mail, didn't you? Or did you unplug all electric devices in insanity?
    Don't think you can escape me by turning your screen off...\r\n\r\nLet me make
    myself clear:\r\nI told you to come to work, and you didn't.\r\nCOME. TO. WORK.
    TOMORROW.\r\nWE. WILL SEE EACH OTHER EYE TO EYE\r\nYou will pay for what you
    did if you don't do it.\r\nYou brought this on yourself. \r\nThis is your fault.\r\n\r\nPs.
    I'm looking for some fur for a doormat, do you know a good spot?"
